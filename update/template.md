# Hi there 👋🏼

I'm Thorsten, a tech enthusiast and software engineer residing in Saarland, Germany's smallest yet most beautiful state. My passion lies in server-side WebAssembly, Containers, Kubernetes, and cloud computing, with a strong focus on Azure.

I work as a Sr. Developer Advocate at [Akamai Technologies](https://akamai.com), empowering developers to build the next wave of cloud computing using Spin, Kubernetes and GenAI.
